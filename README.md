# om_salary_and_membership

App for a small restaurant business, OM.

This app is cross-platform for the purposes of centralised payroll, business revenue and customer membership management systems with a focus on simplicity and usability, bespoke to OM's restaurant business' requirements and designed to integrate into certain business and employee accounting processses.

# Why was this created?
This was done as part of my final year project alongside a dissertation pertaining to the concept, literature backing of respective system principles and laws to consider, design of the proposed system, the process and challenges of implementation, testing plan and results and finally a reflective evaluation.

The participating client, proprieter of OM, requested a system that would replace current paper-based systems they had currently in place for years.
This project's aim was to ensure a highly usable product (for the uncommon less-technically adept users) that had simple functionality to suit their
requirements, as they had been unhappy with other systems used in the past as they over-complicated tasks for the requirements of a small-scale business
such as their own.

The stakeholders (employees who use customer membership module and client, who uses the full service) were thoroughly included in testing procedures, both informally and formally.
Testing includes: 
- Automated Testing via Dart's 'test' package, and 'Mockito' package for emulating firebase datastore in the testing
- Informal testing by myself throughout development
- Informal testing by available stakeholders at minor milestones in development, including informal usability feedback.
- Formal testing by available stakeholders at major milestones in development, including a integration testing procedure to follow.
- Final Formal testing by available stakeholders as part of a Usability study (Time constraints limited this to a single formal usability test)
